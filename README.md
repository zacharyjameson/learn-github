# Learn GitHub

> Note: If you did not set Git's default branch to `main` earlier, all commands will be done on the `master` branch. Before initializing a project, you can set the default with `git config --global init.defaultBranch main`, which only needs to be done once for all projects.

This is a throwaway repo used to learn about working with Git and GitHub.
